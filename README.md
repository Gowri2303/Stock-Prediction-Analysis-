# Stock-Prediction-Analysis-


This project is a Streamlit-based web application that predicts stock prices using a pre-trained deep learning model.
It fetches real-time stock data from Yahoo Finance and compares the actual vs. predicted prices with moving averages to help visualize trends.

**Features**

📊 Fetches real-time stock data from Yahoo Finance
 using yfinance.

🧠 Deep Learning Predictions using a pre-trained Keras model (Latest_stock_price_model.keras).

📉 Moving Averages Analysis (100-day, 200-day, 250-day) to observe long-term and short-term trends.

🔮 Prediction vs Reality → Compares predicted values against real test data.

🖥️ Interactive Dashboard built with Streamlit.
